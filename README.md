## Features

- **Interactive Tutorial**: A comprehensive step-by-step guide to learning 6502 assembly language, with explanations of all core concepts
- **Code Editor**: Write and edit your 6502 assembly code with syntax highlighting
- **Assembler & Debugger**: Assemble your code and debug it with a powerful built-in debugger showing registers, flags, and memory in real-time
- **Visual Game Console**: See your code in action on a virtual display, perfect for creating simple games and graphics
- **Built with Modern Technologies**: Developed in GJS and TypeScript with Adwaita styling for a native GNOME experience

This project is a fork of the [original web-based easy6502 tutorial](https://github.com/skilldrick/easy6502), transformed into a native GNOME application while preserving the core functionality that made the original so effective for learning 6502 assembly.
