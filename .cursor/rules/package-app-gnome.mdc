## Package: `app-gnome`

- **Purpose:** The GNOME desktop application, aiming for a highly integrated native user experience.
- **Primary Technologies:** GJS (JavaScript for GNOME), TypeScript, GTK, Adwaita styling, and Blueprint (`.blp`) for UI definitions.
- **UI:**
    - Leverages native GNOME libraries and Adwaita for a consistent look and feel.
    - UI logic primarily in GJS/TypeScript.
- **Event Handling:** Prefers the custom `event-dispatcher.ts` from `packages/6502/` over raw GNOME signals where appropriate, to maintain consistency with other platforms.
- **Key Focus:** Deep native GNOME integration, adherence to GNOME HIG, leveraging `6502` core and `common-ui` components.
- **Platform APIs:** Directly utilizes native GNOME platform APIs through GJS for all system interactions.
- **Build:** Typically involves Meson. If Vite is used, it's likely for specific web-technology parts within GJS.
