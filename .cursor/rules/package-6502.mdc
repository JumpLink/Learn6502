## Package: `6502` (Core Emulator)

- **Purpose:** Provides the core 6502 CPU emulation, assembler, and disassembler.
- **Primary Language:** TypeScript.
- **Key Focus:** Accuracy of emulation, performance, and platform independence.
- **Interfaces:** Defines core interfaces for CPU state, memory access, and instruction set. Other packages will consume these.
- **Dependencies:** Should have minimal dependencies, especially no UI or platform-specific ones.
- **Code Style:** Prioritize clarity and correctness of the emulation logic. Ensure comprehensive comments for complex algorithms or 6502-specific behaviors.
