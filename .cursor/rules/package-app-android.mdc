## Package: `app-android`

- **Purpose:** The Android application version aiming for deep platform integration.
- **Primary Technologies:** TypeScript and NativeScript (without an additional framework like Angular/Vue).
- **UI:**
    - Utilizes custom components written in TypeScript to wrap native Android widgets (e.g., `fab.ts` for `com.google.android.material.floatingactionbutton.ExtendedFloatingActionButton`).
    - Adheres to Material Design 3 principles.
    - Focus on a native look and feel.
- **Event Handling:** Prefers the custom `event-dispatcher.ts` from `packages/6502` over platform-specific event mechanisms to promote consistent event handling logic across platforms.
- **Key Focus:** Android platform integration, touch-friendly UI, performance on mobile devices, leveraging `6502` core and `common-ui` components.
- **Platform APIs:** Directly utilizes Android SDK via NativeScript for native features.
- **Build:** Standard NativeScript and Android build tools (Gradle).
