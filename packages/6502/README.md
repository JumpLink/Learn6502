# 6502 Package

This package contains a TypeScript implementation of a 6502 assembler and simulator, originally developed by Stian Soreng and adapted by Nick Morgan for the easy6502 tutorial.

## Features

- **Assembler**: Convert 6502 assembly code to machine code
- **Simulator**: Execute 6502 machine code with cycle-accurate emulation
- **Debugger Support**: Monitor registers, flags, and memory in real-time
- **Memory Management**: Handle the 6502's 16-bit address space
- **Instruction Set**: Support for all 6502 instructions and addressing modes

- Further adapted for this project to support both GNOME and web applications

## Usage
