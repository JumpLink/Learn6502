"After a move in each direction, we also need to check to see if the head "
"would become out of bounds. This is handled differently for each direction. "
"For left and right, we can check to see if the head has effectively "
"\"wrapped around\". Going right from <tt>$021f</tt> by incrementing the "
"least significant byte would lead to <tt>$0220</tt>, but this is actually "
"jumping from the last pixel of the first row to the first pixel of the "
"second row. So, every time we move right, we need to check if the new least "
"significant byte is a multiple of <tt>$20</tt>. This is done using a bit "
"check against the mask <tt>$1f</tt>. Hopefully the illustration below will "
"show you how masking out the lowest 5 bits reveals whether a number is a "
"multiple of <tt>$20</tt> or not."

"Because the game state is stored in terms of pixel locations, rendering the "
"game is very straightforward. The first subroutine, <tt>drawApple</tt>, is "
"extremely simple. It sets <tt>Y</tt> to zero, loads a random colour into the "
"accumulator, then stores this value into <tt>($00),y</tt>. <tt>$00</tt> is "
"where the location of the apple is stored, so <tt>($00),y</tt> dereferences "

"Next comes <tt>drawSnake</tt>. This is pretty simple too - we first undraw "
"the tail and then draw the head. <tt>X</tt> is set to the length of the "
"snake, so we can index to the right pixel, and we set <tt>A</tt> to zero "
"then perform the write using the indexed indirect addressing mode. Then we "
"reload <tt>X</tt> to index to the head, set <tt>A</tt> to one and store it "
"at <tt>($10,x)</tt>. <tt>$10</tt> stores the two-byte location of the head, "
"so this draws a white pixel at the current head position. As only the head "
