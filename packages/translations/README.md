## Translation Methods

You can contribute translations in two ways:

1. **Using Weblate**: Visit the [Weblate eu.jumplink.Learn6502 project page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/eu-jumplink-learn6502/app/)
2. **Direct Editing**: Clone the repository and edit the .po files directly. This allows you to test your translations immediately in the app.

New language translations are always welcome! You can start a new language translation either through Weblate or by creating new .po files in the repository.
