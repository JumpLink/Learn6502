# Learn Package

This package contains the core tutorial content for learning 6502 assembly language programming. The content is written in a Markdown [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format and can be transformed into various output formats to support different platforms.

## Content

The main tutorial content is stored in `tutorial.mdx`, which is based on Nick Morgan's original Easy6502 tutorial. The content is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Transformation Capabilities

The package includes tools to transform the MDX content into different formats:

- **GNOME Application**: The content is transformed into GNOME Blueprint UI files (`.ui`) for use in the native GNOME application
- **Web Version**: Planned support for generating web-compatible content
- **Android App**: Potential future support for Android application content

## Development

The transformation process is handled by TypeScript components in the `tsx/` directory:

- `components/`: UI components for different tutorial elements
- `enums/`: Type definitions and constants
- `examples/`: 6502 assembly code examples used in the tutorial

### Building

To build the transformed content:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate the necessary output files in the `dist/` directory.
