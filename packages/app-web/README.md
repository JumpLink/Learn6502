This package contains the classic web version of Easy6502 by Nick Morgan, a one-stop accessible tutorial on 6502 assembly language programming. It includes a series of worked example programs which you can edit and run in the embedded emulator.

This web version is maintained as part of the larger [Learn 6502 Assembly](../../README.md) project, which also provides a modern GNOME desktop application. While the GNOME app offers an enhanced experience, we maintain this web version to preserve the original tutorial's accessibility and simplicity.

The original version can still be found at http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/.

## Development

### Installation

To run the web version locally, execute the following commands:

```
    yarn install
    yarn setup
    yarn build
    yarn start
```

This will serve the site at http://localhost:4000.
